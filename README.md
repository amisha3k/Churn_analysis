# Churn Analysis Project

## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. **Churn analysis** is a key technique used to understand and reduce customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Overview
This project performs a complete **Churn Analysis** using **SQL Server**, **Power BI**, and **Python**. It covers the end-to-end workflow from data extraction and cleaning to predictive modeling and visualization of predicted churners.

---

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Server**: ETL processes, data cleaning, and preparation.
- **Power BI**: Data transformations, interactive dashboards, and visualizations.
- **Python**: Machine learning model development (Random Forest) in Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Workflow

1. **ETL Process in SQL Server**
   - Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process to gather customer data from multiple sources.
   - Data integration and preparation for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning in SQL Server**
   - Handle missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data.
   - Generate clean datasets ready for analysis and modeling.

3. **Power BI Transformations**
   - Apply additional transformations on imported data for reporting.
   - Use Power Query to shape the dataset.

4. **Power BI Visualization & Enhancing Visuals**
   - Create interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics.
   - Enhance visuals with slicers, charts, and KPIs for better insights.

5. **Build Machine Learning Model in Python**
   - Use **Random Forest** classifier to predict customer churn.
   - Feature engineering, model training, and evaluation performed in **Jupyter Notebook**.

6. **Visualize Predicted Data in Power BI**
   - Import predicted churn results into Power BI.
   - Create dashboards to visualize the **Predicted Churner Profile** and other insights.
